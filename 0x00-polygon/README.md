/**
* This simple console application prints the sum of internal angles of 
a regular polygon to standard output.

* This is a test program I built as solution to my dotNet assignment.
*
* The main code can be found in Program.cs
*
* class:
* regularPolygon : an instance of a regular polygon object.
* Attribute:
* sides - a regular polygon is usually defined by the number of it's sides (e.g pentagon - 5 sides).
* length - each side has a length.
*
* Methods:
* internalAng() : returns the sum of the regular polygon
*
* Right engineering, Right documentation.*/
