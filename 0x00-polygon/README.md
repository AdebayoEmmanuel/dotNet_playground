#This simple console application prints the sum of internal angles of 
#a regular polygon to standard output.

This is a test program I built as solution to my dotNet assignment.

The main code can be found in Program.cs

class:
regularPolygon : an instance of the regular polygon object that has a sides and length attribute and internalAng() behaviour;
